# Teacher Lists
## By: Abby Fischler

Schools and school districts don’t always provide enough funding for teachers to provide everything they need for their students. Teachers end up spending their own money on buying supplies for their classrooms. Fortunately, there are people out there who want to help these teachers out. Teachers lists provide these people with a way to help the teachers. This website will store the amazon teacher’s wish list!
